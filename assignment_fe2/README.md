# Service Node Graph Visualization

This project is a React-based visualization tool for service graphs using D3.js. It renders a force-directed graph that represents relationships between different services in a system. Each node in the graph represents a service, and edges represent interactions between these services. The visualization also includes dynamic gradients and tooltips with detailed service information.

## Features

- **Force-Directed Layout**: Uses D3.js to create a dynamic force-directed layout for the service graph.
- **Service Nodes**: Each node represents a service with gradients indicating success ratios.
- **Interactive Tooltips**: Hovering over nodes displays detailed information about the service.
- **Adjustable Force Strength**: A slider to control the strength of the force-directed simulation.
